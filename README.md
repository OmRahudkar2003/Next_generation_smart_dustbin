#Next-Gen Smart Dustbin with IoT & Advanced Sensors | Team Lead & Embedded Developer | *2023â€“2024*
*(ESP32, Arduino, Python, IoT, DHT11, MQ2, Ultrasonic Sensors, Firebase/ESP RainMaker)*

Developed an IoT-based smart dustbin to revolutionize urban waste management, integrating real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, and hazardous gases (methane/CO2) using ESP32 and sensor networks.

Implemented automated waste segregation (dry/wet) using soil moisture sensors, reducing manual effort by 40% and improving recycling efficiency.

Designed a fire detection system with alerts sent to municipal authorities via IoT, reducing emergency response time by 60%.

Built a remote-controlled alarm siren for public safety, enabling Mahanagarpalika to trigger alerts during hazards.

Achieved 90% accuracy in smell detection using MQ2 sensors, minimizing false alarms.
